# Frontend/Fullstack Assesment

The goal of this test is to evaluate how fast you can deliver results as well as your problem solving and decision making skills.

For this test, we do not provide design mockups in order to let the developer express their Front-end knowledge, but we expect you to come up with something simple and understandable. Note, we will not be judging the UX created - so anything simple to develop and logical & easy to understand should work fine.

If you get in "the zone" while working on the test and feel that you can do more then the minimum requirements of the task, please feel free to impress us with your skills and knowhow. It will not go unnoticed.

Feel free to use packages, libraries, Frameworks and even starters/code generators or code snippets, but please mention any code that is not yours and justify the use in a sentence or two.

We expect you to use the following technologies for the Front-end: ReactJS
For the Backend please use the following technologies: NodeJS, Fastify, MongoDB
For both frontend and backend projects, please use Typescript as the programming language

### We Will be evaluating you on the following:

- Code Structure
- Code readability and style (we expect you to use best practices and indicate what guidelines/best practices you followed)
- Logic behind your decisions and choices
- Error handling
- Testing
- Documentation

### Bonus Points:

- User experience (Animation, Transitions ...etc)
- Design decisions (colors, layout... etc)

### Recommended deliverables:

- Detailed documentation that explains how to build and run the project (a README.md file should suffice)
- Detailed list of your choices and justification of the decisions that you feel need to be explained

## The Task:

Included in this repository you will find a file named data.json in the /data folder.
The file contains a list of trades created by a single user over time.
A trade is a financial operation that involves two pair of currencies, e.g:

- Converting 1 USDT to VES
- Converting 40 VES to USDT
- Converting 10000 COP to VES
- etc

We would like to expose this list via a simple API endpoint and allow the client app to consume it and display all the trades of the user in a compact view (something in the line of a dashboard, grid or even a table).

In the client app we expect the user to be able to move from the high-level view to a detailed view where they would be able to see all the information and details of a single trade(this can be a separate view or an expended view in the dashboard, or even a modal ... pick what you feel is better and justify your choice).

Please write tests wherever and whenever you feel adequate

This test should be completed in 6 working hours.
Please ensure to have a working application under that time & if time is not enough, feel free to document the drawbacks or pending work you had in mind that would require additional time.
We suggest working in increments so that you have a working application at all times.
